This is a comprehensive test document designed to trigger potential issues in the PRISMY translation system.

Chapter 1: Introduction
This document contains multiple paragraphs and sections to ensure the translation system processes multiple chunks properly.

Chapter 2: Technical Details  
When processing larger documents, the system goes through several phases:
1. Text extraction from the source document
2. Chunking the text into manageable pieces
3. Translation of each chunk using the selected tier
4. Reconstruction of the final translated document

Chapter 3: Potential Issues
The reconstruction phase is particularly critical as it needs to:
- Combine all translated chunks properly
- Maintain document structure
- Handle page boundaries correctly
- Complete the final status update

Chapter 4: Testing Scenarios
This document should trigger all processing phases and help identify any bottlenecks or stuck conditions at the 90% mark during reconstruction.

Chapter 5: Expected Outcome
If the system works correctly, this document should be fully translated without getting stuck at any percentage, particularly at the 90% reconstruction phase.
