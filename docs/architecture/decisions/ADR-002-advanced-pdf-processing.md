# ADR-002: Advanced PDF Processing Architecture

## Status
PROPOSED

## Context
Current basic PDF extraction loses critical information:
- Tables become unstructured text
- Images are ignored
- Formulas are garbled
- Layout is destroyed

## Decision
Implement modular Advanced PDF Processing system using:
- pdfplumber for structure analysis
- camelot-py for table extraction
- pytesseract for OCR
- Custom layout preservation algorithm

## Consequences

### Positive
- 95%+ accuracy in data extraction
- Preserves document intelligence
- Enables new use cases (reports, analysis)
- Competitive advantage

### Negative
- Increased complexity
- Higher processing time (5s vs 1s)
- Additional dependencies
- More testing required

## Implementation Plan
1. Create AdvancedPDFProcessor module
2. Implement each sub-component
3. Integrate with existing pipeline
4. Extensive testing
5. Gradual rollout

## Review
- Proposed by: Architecture Team
